# Stats 20
Stats 20 is Introduction to Statistical Programming in R, who I took under James Molyneux in Fall of 2016. I have included my 3 homework assignments and final project. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in R. My final grade in the class was an A+, however I did not score perfectly on all of the assignments. My grades for the homework assignments and final project are as follows:

|   Assignment  | Grade  |
----------------|--------
| HW 1          | 97.94% |
| HW 2          | 90.88% |
| HW 3          | 92.71% |
| Final Project | 97.5%  |
